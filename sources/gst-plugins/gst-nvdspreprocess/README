Refer to the DeepStream SDK documentation for a description of the plugin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-requisites:
- GStreamer-1.0 Development package
- GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins Development package

Install using:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling and installing the plugin:
Export or set in Makefile the appropriate cuda version using CUDA_VER
Run make and sudo make install

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

About:
This plugin performs customs preprocessing using custom lib to the region of interest (ROI)
provided in config file. User can provide custom group tranformation function and
custom tensor preparation function from custom library in config file. The raw tensor
is attached as user meta which is used by nvinfer for inferencing while skipping
preprocessing there.

NOTE:
1. Custom Library needs to be compiled separately and provide the .so file here.
2. For optimal performance, set nvinfer batch-size in config file same as
   sum total of rois in nvdspreprocess config file.
3. Currently preprocessing only for primary gie has been supported.

Run:
gst-launch-1.0 uridecodebin uri= file:///samples/streams/sample_1080p_h264.mp4 ! m.sink_0 \
