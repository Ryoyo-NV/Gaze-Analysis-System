Refer to the DeepStream SDK documentation for a description of the plugin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-requisites:
- GStreamer-1.0 Development package
- GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins Development package
- OpenCV Development package

Install using:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
       libopencv-dev

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling and installing the plugin:
Export or set in Makefile the appropriate cuda version using CUDA_VER
Run make and sudo make install

NOTE: 
1. To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.
2. This plugin contains additional optimized sample which supports batch processing
of buffers. Refer to the Makefile for using optimized sample.
3. OpenCV has been deprecated by default, so blur-objects will not work.
   To enable OpenCV in dsexample, set `WITH_OPENCV=1` in the plugin Makefile
   (/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/gst-plugins/gst-dsexample/Makefile)
   and follow compilation and installation instructions present in this README.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corresponding config file changes (Add the following section). GPU ID might need
modification based on the GPU configuration:
[ds-example]
enable=1
processing-width=640
processing-height=480
full-frame=0
#batch-size for batch supported optimized plugin
batch-size=1
unique-id=15
gpu-id=0
blur-objects=0
# Supported memory types for blur-objects are 1 and 3
nvbuf-memory-type=3
